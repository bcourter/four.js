Four.js: Taking Three.js to the next dimension

The vision is to make an open 4D mesh modeling tool for artists based on WebGL and Three.js.  Four.js comprises the necessary 4D libraries, written in the style of Three.js.  Tessinteract is the name of the modeling application.

Currently just experimenting as I get this thing boot strapped.  Happy to take on collaborators.
